# Json RepairFix
 A short windows-service intented script that will fix a JSON with hotkey

Select a JSON as text
Press Shift+Alt+J
The JSON should be replaced with a fixed one.

The script can fix missing quotes (" ") either on start or end of attribute name or attribute value,
missing brackets ([ ]) either on start or end of attribute value and missing curly braces ({ }) from the JSON text.

This can be tested while running from command line or used as a windows service.
